Needs Qt 4, VTK, ITK

VTK needs to be built with GUI support and the QVTKWidget  (Two options in the
Advanced CMake menu.  First configure the GUI support, then QT support.)

Builds easiest with VTK 5.4.2.  Building with VTK versions greater than 5.4.2
needed to configure VTK build without objective c garbage collection.
