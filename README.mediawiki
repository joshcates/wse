== What is this? ==
The Watershed Editor tool is a standalone application for volume segmentation using the ITK watershed transform filter (itkWatershedSegmenter, etc).  This is an updated Qt version of the InsightApplications WatershedEditor example app.

Dependencies are Qt 4, VTK, ITK and possibly QWT.  Builds with CMake.

== Status ==
Very much a work in progress. Estimated alpha version by late Summer 2011. 

== Relationship to Slicer 4 ==
This project is a side-effect of work on a Slicer 4 watershed segmentation module, which will reuse parts of this Qt interface and all of the underlying processing logic.
